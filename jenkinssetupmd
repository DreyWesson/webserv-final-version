Setting up Jenkins for CI/CD to manage Git pull requests, running valgrind, make, containerizing with Docker, and running linters before accepting pull requests involves several steps. Here's a comprehensive guide to get you started from installation to configuration:

Step 1: Install Jenkins
On Ubuntu
Add Jenkins Repository and Key:

```
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
```

Install Jenkins:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins
```

Start Jenkins:
```
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
```
Access Jenkins:
Open your browser and go to http://your_server_ip_or_domain:8080. Use the initial admin password found in /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword.

Step 2: Install and Configure Required Plugins
Basic Setup:

Follow the Jenkins setup wizard, installing suggested plugins.
Additional Plugins:

Go to Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins > Available.
Install the following plugins:
Git Plugin
GitHub Integration Plugin
Pipeline Plugin
Docker Pipeline Plugin
Warnings Next Generation (for linters)
Blue Ocean (for a modern UI, optional but recommended)
Step 3: Configure Global Tool Configuration
JDK and Maven:

Go to Manage Jenkins > Global Tool Configuration.
Configure JDK by adding JDK installations if necessary.
Add Maven if you plan to use it.
Docker:

Ensure Docker is installed on the Jenkins server:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io
sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
```

Restart Jenkins:
```
sudo systemctl restart jenkins
```

Create a Pipeline Job
Create a New Pipeline Job:

Go to Jenkins > New Item.
Select Pipeline and give it a name.
Configure Git Repository:

Under Pipeline > Definition, select Pipeline script from SCM.
Choose Git and add the repository URL.
Add credentials if needed.
Step 5: Write Jenkinsfile
Create a Jenkinsfile in the root of your Git repository to define your pipeline. Here's an example Jenkinsfile:

```
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker { image 'ubuntu:latest' }
    }
    environment {
        CC = 'clang'
        CXX = 'clang++'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/your-repo.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Install Dependencies') {
            steps {
                sh 'apt-get update && apt-get install -y clang make valgrind python3 python3-flask perl'
            }
        }
        stage('Lint') {
            steps {
                sh 'python3 -m pip install flake8'
                sh 'flake8 your_code_directory'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'make'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'valgrind --leak-check=full ./your_binary'
            }
        }
        stage('Containerize') {
            steps {
                script {
                    docker.build('your_image_name')
                }
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        always {
            junit 'path_to_your_test_reports/*.xml'
        }
        success {
            echo 'Build was successful!'
        }
        failure {
            echo 'Build failed.'
        }
    }
}
```

Configure Webhooks (GitHub)
Setup Webhooks:
In your GitHub repository, go to Settings > Webhooks > Add webhook.
Set the payload URL to http://your_jenkins_url/github-webhook/.
Choose application/json as the content type.
Select Just the push event or Send me everything.
Step 7: Run and Monitor the Pipeline
Trigger the Build:

Push changes to your GitHub repository to trigger the build.
Alternatively, you can trigger the build manually in Jenkins.
Monitor:

Use the Jenkins Blue Ocean UI for a modern interface to monitor builds and pipelines.
Check console output, test results, and docker image creation status.
Additional Tips
Security and Users:

Set up user authentication and authorization under Manage Jenkins > Configure Global Security.
Create user roles and assign permissions appropriately.
Backup and Maintenance:

Regularly back up your Jenkins home directory (/var/lib/jenkins).
Keep Jenkins and its plugins up-to-date for security and functionality.
Conclusion
With these steps, you have set up Jenkins to handle CI/CD for your projects, including linting, building, testing, and containerizing your applications. This setup ensures a robust pipeline that can catch issues early and streamline your development process.
